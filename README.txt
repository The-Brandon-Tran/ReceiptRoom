Brandon's Personal Project
This will be a phone application that will be able to calculate the price of items on printed receipts.
The items can be indiviually selected and divided out properly with tax to make ease of use for people
to pay other back rather than split a bill in a resturant. It will have to use an ORC that will allow
for text to be read through the camera or previously taken pictures. They could also keep a record of
pictures and prices on individual elements.

Must find free ORC and parse infomation into application.
